Ask the following question to your Line Manager:
  * How are exceptions logged in our code?
  * When should I catch an exception and when should I throw it?
  * Do we create our own Exception classes or use the built in ones from Java?
  * Can I see some example logs which show the type of exceptions thrown each day?
