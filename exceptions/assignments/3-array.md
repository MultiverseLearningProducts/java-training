## Steps

  1. In the `ExceptionDemos` class, add a method called `printArray` which takes an `ArrayList` of Strings as a parameter
  1. Write code in this method to loop through the array from index 0 to 10, printing the value of each array element
  1. Call this method from the class `main` method, passing in an ArrayList which has only 5 elements.

## Questions to answer
(add the answers to these questions as Javadoc comments above your method)
  1. What exception is thrown?
  1. Google to find the Javadoc for this exception and read the description of the exception
  1. What type of exception is this? (Error, RuntimeException, other Exception) - Hint - look at the superclass(es) (inheritance hierarchy) of the exception
  1. Should you explicitly catch this exception in your code? Expand your answer with reasons.
  1. How many frames are there in your stack trace? 
  1. Which line of code generated the exception?
