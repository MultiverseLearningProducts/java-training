## Steps

  1. Create a new checked exception class called `InvalidInputException` which inherits from the appropriate subclass of Throwable - you can use [this website](https://mkyong.com/java/java-custom-exception-examples/) to help you
  1. In the `ExceptionDemos` class, add a method called `checkInput` which takes a String parameter
  1. Add code to throw an `InvalidInputException` if the length of the String is greater than 10
  1. Ensure all the code in the class compiles

## Questions to answer
(add the answers to these questions as Javadoc comments above your method)
  1. How would your code differ if `InvalidInputException` was an unchecked exception?
