## Steps

  1. In the `ExceptionDemos` class, add a method called `greet` which takes a String value called `name` as an argument
  1. Add code to this `greet` method to print "Hello" then the name value *in uppercase* e.g. "Hello MANDY"
  1. Call this method from the class `main` method, passing in a `null` name value.

## Questions to answer
