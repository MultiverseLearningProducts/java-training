# Jackson

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to read JSON from a file and convert it to an object and vice-versa

## Lesson plan ideas
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is readable by humans and easy to parse by machines.

JSON has 2 key structures:

name/value pairs (realised as an Object in languages such as JavaScript and Java)
An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.
