# SpringBoot

This directory holds a sample project which can be cloned to give developers an understanding of what a Spring Boot Rest application looks like. 

The reader should have familiarity with the following prior to using the code:
  * Java basic language features
  * The concept of Spring annotations 
  * The concept of RESTful web services
  * A high level understanding of SQL databases

Note that this code is NOT production ready, it exists solely to demonstrate concepts.
